# Replace Anything

A simple web application that lets you replace any part of an image with an image generated based on your description.

![Demo](./assets/demo.gif)

‚úÇÔ∏è Generate a mask using the Segment Anything Model ([SAM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#getting-started)) by Meta AI Research. SAM is able to accurately identify and isolate the specific areas of the image that you want to edit.

üé® Replace the specific parts of the image based on a text prompt using Diffusers library [Inpaint Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/inpaint) by Hugging Face. This ensures smooth and seamless blending of the edited portions with the rest of the image, resulting in a natural and realistic final product.

üç± Serve the application and models with Gradio on [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML).

## Getting Started
First download the trained model checkpoint [ViT-H SAM model](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth). 
```
./download_model.sh
```

Before running the scripts, make sure you install the dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use bentoml to serve the model.
```
bentoml serve
```

You can access the WebUI through the /interface endpoint. The root / path is the Swagger debugging page provided by BentoML.
